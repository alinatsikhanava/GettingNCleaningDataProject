## Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data from raw data.

Raw data was obtained from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The repo contains:
* 'README.md' - overview of the repo
* 'run_analysis.R' - the script that transforms raw data into tidy data
* 'tidy.txt' - the result tidy data set, 
* 'CodeBook.md' - a text file that describes the data and transformations performed to clean up the data.
